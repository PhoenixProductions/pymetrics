This is a simple set of python scripts to allow for 
(simplified) natural language entry of personal metrics for 
analysis (see Stephen Wolfram's article for origin idea).

It is split into 3 parts:
* a raw data collector (metricsparser.py)
* a pre-parser which collates activities into "item" logs
* an analyser which will produce some outputs from the data.
